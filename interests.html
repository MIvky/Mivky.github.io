  <h2>My Interests</h2>
  <hr>
  <ol>


  <li><h3>Reading and literature</h3></li>
<p><em>"A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies . . . The man who never reads lives only one."</em><br>

George R.R. Martin</p>

<p>I think there's not much to add here. I love reading, from fictional books to biographies; from great epic works to short stories. In a sea of information we gain from looking
on our screens, I believe it to be neccessary to shut out all mental diversions and plunge into a solid text, that's a window in an another persons' thinking. It broadens
your perspective and your knowledge. Hell, somewhere, someone probably went what we're going through. Maybe they'll give us some kind of answer.</p>

  <li><h3>Music</h3></li>
    <p><em>"Do it again on the next verse and people think you meant it."</em><br>
Chet Atkins</p>
<p>If it's not clear from my CV and my current job, music is a big part of me. Since I was a small lad I was involved with a lot of choirs and ansambles.
Music gave me the option to travel, to meet other people from all walks of life. Because of this little interes, I've traveled to France, Germany, Poland, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Ireland, Chille, Italy, Montenegro, Serbia, Bulgaria, Slovakia. I've performed in front of more than 50.000 people, and I've performed in more intimate occassions.
Nevertheles, music gave me a livelihood, and the opportunity to broaden my perspective.</p>

<li><h3>Travel</h3></li>
<p><em>"Not all those who wander are lost"</em><br>
 J.R.R. Tolkien</p>

<p>I don't love traveling, per se, but I love new countries, new cultures, new mentalities. Much of my travels came thorugh my involvement in music. I love the small differences
in culture between two countries. Those differences can be a solid foothold for a potential problem, but it can be a solution. Not for nothing, traveling gives us
the ability to feel, breathe, taste and hear the local customs, enriched by tradition, and it can give us the ability to see our own country with a new set of glasses.</p>

<li><h3>Cooking</h3></li>
<p><em>I like eating, cooking and shopping. It all goes together.</em><br>
Kyle MacLachlan</p>
<p>I've yet to meet a person who doesn't love to eat. Cooking, on the other hand is a different thing. Some people don't hate it, some people do, but I love it.
And I don't love the quick and snappy recipes that are easy. I love the multy-hour outdoor cooking, like barbecue, or bean stew; you know, the things that take up most of your weekend. That casual 20 minute
stir-fry doesn't interest me, no sir. I like them looking in the open fire with a beer in my hand and a possy of my friends telling me how I should do it. </p>


<hr>
<li><h3>Quizzes</h3></li>
<p><em>"The enthusiasm and confidence you bring to Trivia Nights is rivaled only by the impressive consistency
  with which you are always wrong"</em><br>
Anonymus</p>
<p>From a young age, I loved reading, and more precisely, I loved tiny, trivial information that can't possibly help you in any way or form in you life. I was a dweeb. I still am, I suppose.
</p>


<hr>
<li><h3>Continuous learning and skill improvement</h3></li>
<p><em>"Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn."</em><br>
Benjamin Franklin</p>


<p>It may be cliche, but I do love learning and improving on my skills. As a Master of Theology, I've gained some basics in humanistic thinking, critical thinking. On the other hand, I love practical skills also; beekeping, woodworking, mechanical work, electrical too. </p>

<hr>
<li><h3>Front-end development</h3></li>
<p><em>"Things arenâ€™t always #000000 and #FFFFFF"</em><br>
HTML Proverb</p>

<p>I'm very new to FE development, and would like to work as a Front-end developer in some time. I find it fascinating and frustrating at the same time and it gives me another creative outlet.</p>
